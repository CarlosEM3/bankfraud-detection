# bank-fraud-detection

Overview:

The project aimed to develop a fraud detection system for banking transactions using supervised machine learning techniques, specifically focusing on the Random Forest Classifier algorithm. Given the inherent imbalance in fraud detection datasets where fraudulent cases constitute a minority class, the challenge was to accurately identify fraudulent transactions while minimizing false positives. The dataset comprised synthetic bank transaction records, containing both discrete and continuous variables.
